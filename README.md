# UV5-RM-MOD
This repo contains new firmware for Baofeng UV5-RM radios adding new apps including texting. CAUTION: CHIRP will no longer work so use the included apps to program channels and categories

Custom firmware and add-on apps for the Baofeng UV-5RM, built on the open-source
[bf-5rh-firmware-open](https://github.com/sophiel-meow/bf-5rh-firmware-open). The main addition
is `TEXT`: short text messages between two radios, with delivery confirmation and no phone,
internet or extra hardware.

> **Flashing can't be undone.** No copy of the factory firmware is known for this hardware, so
> there's no way back to stock, and CHIRP stops working with the radio. A bad flash could brick
> it. This has only been run on two radios, so use it at your own risk.

## What it adds

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **TEXT** | Sends messages up to 50 characters, retries until confirmed, saves them, and plays a tone when one arrives |
| **Scan modes** | Press Band to switch between Weather, Police/Fire/EMS, Air, Repeaters, FRS, GMRS, MURS and more, or type a custom range |
| **BAND SWEEP** | Sweeps a whole band for activity |
| **RPT FINDER** | Works out a repeater's input frequency and tone |
| **FOX HUNT** | Signal meter and rough distance estimate for finding a transmitter |
| **SEARCH/QT SCAN** | Finds a nearby signal's frequency, or the tone on your channel; press 1 to switch |
| **Look and feel** | Skull start-up logo, black and red menus, and a custom start-up tune |

Screenshots: see the `preview_*.png` files in `UV-5RM Custom Firmware`.

## Before you start: check your radio

This firmware only fits one hardware version. Radios that look identical can have a different chip.

1. Turn the radio off, then hold **8** while turning it on.
2. Read the text on the screen, then turn the radio off without pressing anything else.

| Screen says | What to do |
|---|---|
| `5RHNRFB-YP07` | This is the right hardware, so carry on |
| Anything else, such as `...NRF` or `...BK` | **Don't flash it.** It may boot but not transmit or receive |

## What you need

- A Windows PC. The tools are Python, so other systems may work, but they're untested.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), plus the serial library: `py -m pip install pyserial`
- A Baofeng programming cable. The commands below assume `COM3`, so change it to match your port.

Run these from the `UV-5RM Custom Firmware` folder.

## Install

**1. Back up the radio.** Flash mode can't read it, so do this first, with the radio on and on
its main screen. This only reads. It may not answer until the radio has been power-cycled, and
the folder has to exist.

```
mkdir my-backup
py source-changes\radio_read.py COM3 my-backup\factory_memory.img
```

**2. Enter flash mode.** Turn the radio off, hold **both side buttons** and turn it on. The screen
stays black. Check that it answers (this doesn't write anything):

```
py source-changes\bootloader_probe.py COM3
```

**3. Flash.** This is the point of no return. It takes under a minute, so don't touch the radio or
the cable. The long number is a checksum, and the tool refuses a file that doesn't match it.

```
py source-changes\flash_bf.py UV-5RM_Custom_Firmware.BF COM3 4340f205430f0741
```

**4. Install the logo and apps.** Wait for the radio to restart to its main screen. This reads
everything back to confirm it.

```
py source-changes\setup_radio.py COM3 skull_logo.rgb565 64 apps
```

**5. Turn on transmit.** It starts off as a safety step. Go to `SETTINGS` and set `TXINH` to off.

**6. Load channels (optional).** Open `UV-5RM_Channel_Uploader.html` in Chrome or Edge. The channel
list in this repo is for Clark County, Nevada, so check that it suits your area. Your radio should
keep whatever channels it already had.

To choose which channels get scanned, open `UV-5RM_Scan_Builder.html`, tick the ones you want, and
load the CSV it saves into the uploader.

Optional extras: `set_boot_tune.py` sets a Doom-style start-up riff, and `set_radio2_mario_tune.py`
sets a Super Mario one but only runs on one specific radio, so copy and edit it for yours.

## Using TEXT

Both radios need `TEXT` open, on the same simplex frequency. It uses the frequency the radio was on
when you opened it. Don't use a repeater.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Number keys | Type, flip-phone style; the letters are shown at the top of the screen |
| **Menu** | Send |
| **Exit** | Delete a letter; stops retries while sending; closes the app when nothing is typed |
| Hold **Exit** | Close the app |
| **Up / Down** | Scroll saved messages |
| **\*** | Send a numbered test ping |
| **A/B** | Switch between low (default) and high power |
| Hold **#** twice | Erase all saved messages |

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `>` | Sent, waiting for a reply |
| `+` | The other radio confirmed it |
| `!` | Never confirmed. It may still have arrived, since only the reply may have been lost |
| `<` | Received |

**Limits:**
- A radio only receives while `TEXT` is open.
- It's built for two radios; with more, the automatic replies would collide.
- Messages have **no encryption**, and they're stored unencrypted on the radio. Scrambling isn't
  security, so any radio with this app can read them.
- Range and long messages have barely been tested. Most testing was short pings a few feet apart.

## Legal

You're responsible for what you transmit.

- **`TEXT` transmits on its own.** With the app open, the radio sends a reply automatically to any
  message it receives, so stay on a frequency you're licensed for.
- **Ham bands:** you need a license and must identify with your callsign. `TEXT` doesn't send one,
  so you'd have to identify by voice. Encrypting messages isn't allowed.
- **FRS, GMRS and MURS:** this radio isn't type-accepted for them, so treat those channels as
  receive-only. Rules also vary by country.
- **Power:** output hasn't been measured, and the radio's actual power may differ from its label.

## Building from source

`firmware-source` is the complete source of the provided firmware and apps; the firmware and `TEXT`
were confirmed to rebuild byte for byte. It needs [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and the target in its
`rust-toolchain.toml`. Use a short `--target-dir`, because long paths break linking on Windows.

```
cargo build --release --manifest-path firmware-source/Cargo.toml --config firmware-source/.cargo/config.toml --target-dir C:/t/fw
py source-changes/elf2bin.py C:/t/fw/thumbv7em-none-eabi/release/bf5rh-fw fw.bin
```

`source-changes` holds the patches against upstream and the PC tools. `source-changes/simulator` runs
the apps against a simulated radio, with no hardware needed:

```
cargo build --release --manifest-path source-changes/simulator/Cargo.toml --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --target-dir C:/t/sim
C:/t/sim/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/sim.exe out-folder skull_logo.rgb565
```

The output folder has to exist. The simulator only checks logic, so it can't prove how a real radio
behaves on the air.

## AIRBAND feature

The optional [AIRBAND app and database](UV-5RM%20Custom%20Firmware/airband/README.md)
add offline US airport/VOR lookup, service selection, favorites, scanning and
manually centered nearby lists. AIRBAND is receive-only and appears as the first
item in the Band/SCAN frequency-mode list when firmware is built with
`--features airband`.

This feature does not contain RF-chip or board-support changes. On `5RHBK`
hardware it is intended to be combined with the separate work in PR #3 after
that support is applied. It also does not change the firmware's global boot or
menu backgrounds.

FAA data can be refreshed independently of firmware. The
[database update guide](UV-5RM%20Custom%20Firmware/airband/README.md#updating-from-faa-sources)
documents how to select an effective NASR cycle, download `APT.zip`, `FRQ.zip`
and `NAV.zip`, build and test `airband.db`, and upload only the database while
preserving favorites.

Automatic location and VOR radial decoding are not implemented. The separate
[research proposal](docs/airband-location-future/README.md) documents the data,
signal-processing and validation work that would be required.
